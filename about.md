Who is Dylan Reed? Why is Dylan so awesome? Why should you care? These are all questions I plan to answer in this section, thus the boring title. I have wrestled with this page for days and have finally narrowed down my ideas to focus on those three questions.

Who is Dylan Reed?

He is I and I am him. I was born, raised and still reside in Greeley, Colorado. You may recognize Greeley from accounts of how much it smells or possibly from the recent JBS/Swift immigration raids. Even if you don’t know where it is you’ll do ok as I try to refer as little as possible to Greeley in my posts.

I was raised without a television, as was my brother, which makes sense, so I learned to read at a young age and have read a lot. The unfortunate downfall to this is that I had a hard time separating TV from reality. For instance when I watched E.T. I thought that the government was really torturing an alien and was in tears while I watched it. I was twelve.

In high school I started clowning, juggling, unicycling and making balloon animals. This was my great ploy to get the girls. The first balloons I learned to make were hearts and teddy bears holding flowers, I then learned to make the six petal flower. That was the balloon that should have gotten me the girls. It worked ok, but a gentleman doesn’t say.

After high school I dropped out of two different colleges before heading to Long Beach and attending the College of Oceaneering. I studied commercial diving, specifically non-destructive testing, and worked primarily at Hollywood Video. I met some really cool people and learned a lot about diving. I also started this blog while there though my writing left a lot to be desired. Shortly after moving back to Greeley I married my wonderful wife Sarah. Our marriage kicks other marriages butts.

After working a few other jobs (with disabled people, for a materials testing company, at a funplex, at Starbucks and for the City of Greeley) I started working for my dad as a property manager. This led to me getting my Real Estate License. I don’t like or dislike my job, I just do it and hope to someday do something else.

After a couple years of working for my Dad I was done. It was either hate my dad or find a new job. So I went back to school. I didn’t quite finish due to money. As in “We need more money”.

Luckily Harper was able to help me find a job at Graphicly. I worked there for about 18 months. I started out as just an assistant but moved on to doing QA on a bunch of android apps. This job taught me attention to detail and the importance of getting things done. I was lucky enough to get to work from home during this period, which spoiled me rotten.

After I was done at Graphicly I went back to work as a property manager for my dad. Because once you are in the family business you cannot escape.

Why is Dylan so awesome?

This is a hard question to answer since awesomeness is subjective. What it boils down to is that I go through life trying to have the most fun possible. This is what leads me to being awesome all the time. A lot of people try to be awesome but few succeed. The trick is not letting people know that you think you are awesome until you are sure that you are awesome. Confused? So am I.

Why should you care?

Mostly because unlike a lot of blogs that cover one subject I try to cover a bundle of topics. There is also no rhyme or reason to what I write about. I write about what I feel like writing about, when I feel like writing about it. This leads to a lot of random posts as well as a few old standby topics.

If you are tired of having to scour the web looking for the content you want to read, come here. I can’t guarantee that you will find what you are looking for, but I can say that you will have a good time looking. If you like my style, cool, subscribe. If not, subscribe anyway, I’ll grow on you. Like a fungus.
