Ellie is a normal high school girl having another boring summer. She works at her parents hardware store and has just broken up with her boyfriend. She didnâ€™t plan on becoming a superhero. Frustrated by her recent breakup she was just trying to move on.

A rash of robberies have the police running in circles. No one seems to be able to stop The Rat from running rampant through the city. Until now.

The Correspondent is just doing her best, trying to protect her city and her family. Will it be enough?

A planet for cats? 
The Squirrel? 
An Election? 

What is happening? 

This collection of short stories doesn't have a theme. One of the stories is absurd, one of them has a message (I think) and one is just plain weird. This is a short collection of short stories. A nice quick read for you to enjoy and share.
