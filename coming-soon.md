<h3>The Correspondent is back!!</h3>

After defeating The Rat, Ellie hangs up her mask, or at least that is what she told her mom. She promised that she would not go out looking for danger, but what if it finds her?

While doing some routine patrolling she is attacked by two of the strongest henchmen she has ever encountered. Can she figure out what they want while navigating school, her internship with the police, and family life?

Coming Soon to your favorite retailers.
