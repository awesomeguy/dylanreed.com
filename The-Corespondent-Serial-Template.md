#The Correspondent 

The Correspondent is a web serial by [Dylan Reed](www.twitter.com/dylanreed).

*People always talk about where they were when they first heard about the Correspondent. She came out of nowhere and was trying to make a difference. Some saw her as a beacon of hope, others as a sign of how far down the slope we had come. I never paid attention to all of that. I was too busy. Too busy working to pay my bills, too busy trying to figure out life. I was seventeen when it started. I was the Correspondent. This is my story.*
